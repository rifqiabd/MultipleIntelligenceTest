# Admin Dashboard Components

This document explains the component structure of the Admin Dashboard, which has been refactored to improve maintainability and code organization.

## Component Structure

The Admin Dashboard is now built using several smaller, purpose-specific components:

1. **Header**: Displays the dashboard header with gradient background, user profile button, logout button, and connection status.

2. **QuickStats**: Shows summary statistics like total test results, most common intelligence type, and average age.

3. **Charts**: Visualizes intelligence type distribution using radar and bar charts.

4. **Filters**: Provides filtering options for test results by class, date range, name, and dominant intelligence type.

5. **SortIndicator**: Visual indicator for sorted columns in the results table.

6. **ExportButtons**: Buttons to export test results in different formats (CSV, Excel, PDF).

7. **ResultsTable**: Displays the test results in a sortable, filterable table.

8. **ResultDetail**: Modal component for viewing detailed test results.

9. **ProfileUpdate**: Modal component for updating user profile information.

10. **ResultsCard**: Container component that combines filters, sorting controls, and the results table.

## Data Flow

- The main `AdminDashboard` component fetches and manages all data.
- Data and callback functions are passed down to child components via props.
- Components are designed to be reusable and maintain a single responsibility.

## Future Improvements

- Consider implementing a state management solution like Context API or Redux if the application grows larger.
- Add unit tests for individual components.
- Implement error boundaries for better error handling.
